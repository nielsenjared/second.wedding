            Due to the small venue and money, our guest list is very limited, so that means no children and no +1s. We're sorry! But also, you made it. Please fill this out to RSVP!

           We're really excited to celebrate with everyone in the city we love! Friday (9/5) at 4pm we'll host an optional BYOB cookout at 1915 Fairbank Road. Saturday (9/6) please join us at <a href="https://goodneighborshop.com/">good neighbor</a> at 6pm for cocktail hour. The ceremony will begin at 7pm with food and dancing to follow until 10pm. TBD afterparty plans but there will be... Sunday morning we'll be at good neighbor for anyone who wants to come by for coffee and/or food from 11-1pm. We encourage folks to come for the weekend if possible and get a Vrbo or Airbnb in the Hampden neighborhood so you can walk to places. Only street parking is available at the venue so if possible please take a ride share. The venue is walkable from the Woodberry Light Rail Station.

        <p>
            Its the greatest love story ever told. Libraries, yoga, mistaken identity, a brazen amount of exposed flesh- and if you're coming to this you were a part of it in some way!
